        The Pizza Party story is really the story about America, from Naples to
        New York Cityto Buffalo, NY. In 1938 at the age of 12 and 15 Giovanni and Carlo
        Pardini left thier home in Naples, Italy to achieve the American dream. After a short stay
        at Ellis Islandthier name was shortened to <i>"Pardi"</i>, they lived in New York City
        until leaving for Buffalo in 1950. The brothers opened up <em>"Pizzeria di Pardi"</em> on
        Grant street in Buffalo's west side. In 1986 we expanded to 8 locations in western NY and Pizzeria
        di Pardi became Pizza Party! Today we have three locations serving up the classic
        pizza & wings Buffalo is known for our original location as well as our Hertel Aveneue 
        and UB locations.
