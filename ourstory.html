    <p>The Pizza Party story is really the story about America, from Naples to New York City to Buffalo, NY. In 1938 at the age of 
        12 and 15 Giovanni and Carlo Pardini left thier home in Naples, Italy to achieve the American dream. After a short stay at Ellis
        Island thier name was shortened to "Pardi", they lived in New York City until leaving for Buffalo in 1950. The bothers opened up
        "Pizzeria di Pardi" on Grant st in Buffalo's west side. In 1986 we expanded to 8 locations in western NY and Pizzeria di Pardi 
        became Pizza Party! Today we have three locations serving the classic pizza and wings Buffalo is known for
        at the original shop on Grant st and at our Hertel aveneue and UB locations.
