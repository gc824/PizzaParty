    <p style="background-color:tomato;">
        The Pizza Party story is really the story about America, from Naples to New York City<br/>
        to Buffalo, NY. In 1938 at the age of 12 and 15 Giovanni and Carlo Pardini left thier<br/>
        home in Naples, Italy to achieve the American dream. After a short stay at Ellis Island<br/>
        thier name was shortened to <i>"Pardi"</i>, they lived in New York City until leaving for<br/>
        Buffalo in 1950. The brothers opened up <em>"Pizzeria di Pardi"</em> on Grant street in Buffalo's<br/>
        west side. In 1986 we expanded to 8 locations in western NY and Pizzeria di Pardi became<br/>
        <b>Pizza Party!</b> Today we have three locations serving up the classic pizza & wings Buffalo <br/>
        is known for our original location as well as our Hertel Aveneue and UB locations.
